This repo is meant to be a place where I can experiment with technologies and publish small utilities.
Not everything here is production ready and many may be left as they are, without further development. So if you want to use the code, be aware of it's current state
(many are just a **P**roof **O**f **C**oncept).

Projects:
- **_[abJS](/abJS)_** ( Javascript, *POC* ): A mini javascript library that enables "extending" existing functions by executing in
parallel a series of "attached" functions

- **_[ArgsParser](/ArgsParser)_** ( C# ): Single class utility that provides a set of basic features that can be used to easly parse the
argument given to a console application

- **_[Remoting](/Remoting)_** ( C#, *POC* ): Demo app exploring different solutions for remotely execute methods on an instance of a class implementing a shared interface.

- **_[MKCache](/MKCache)_** ( C# ): A cache type that allows to cache an element using more than one key.
