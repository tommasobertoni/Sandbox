#abJS
######*(Attached Behaviour JS)*

##Absract
A mini javascript library that enables to "extend" existing functions by executing in parallel a series of "attached" functions 
(hence Attached Behaviour) before the execution of the target function.

To achieve the asynchronous execution, **abJS** uses the [Q library](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) (a promise library for javascript), allowing the execution of 
intrinsic asynchronous functions (has somebody ever heard of *ajax*?).

As of today, **this is a Proof Of Concept**.
